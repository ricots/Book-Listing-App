**Platform: Android (Min SDK: 15, Target SDK: 24)**

Simple Android app that allows user to search books from Google Play Books database using the Google Books APIs by simply entering the book keyword.

_This app is created as the seventh project of Android Basics Nanodegree program at Udacity._

**Features:**
- Search thousands of books from Google Play Books simply by entering a keyword.
- Lightweight and minimalist design. Support for book details will be added in future version.

**What I have learned from this project:**
- Fetching data from an API using HTTP request.
- Using AsyncTask to perform network operations in the background thread.
- Parsing a JSON response to get the required data for the model class.
- Creating a list that contains the data and display to the user.
